CS 265
Advanced Programming Techniques

Taught by one and only Professor Kurt Schmidt.
He loves terminal, hates using the mouse pointer. That essentially was the course as well.
We learned bash, python scripts, makefiles etc. All of it done just in the terminal.
There's also a debugger that works with VIm, that makes no sense to me though..

Cheers
