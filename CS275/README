CS 275
Web and Mobile App Development

It was more Web, less Mobile. We learned API calls and controls. A lot of HTML, PHP, JavaScript, JQuery etc..
Didn't like it one bit, because the main project of the course was a group project, and my group literally didn't do anything.
But otherwise, I got to learn a lot!

Cheers
