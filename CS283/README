CS 283
Systems Programming

Finally a course, that actually justifies to be in the major!
We learned so much! THe language that we primarily used was C. It made me have a sort of love-hate relationship with the language.
We leanred a lot, such as ports, security! We actually created our own SQL for the terminal, how cool is that!

Cheers
