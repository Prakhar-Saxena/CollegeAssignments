The purpose of this assignment was to implement "Four-In-A-Row" game using forks and pipes using parent and children processes. The fork enabled the processes/games to run simultaneously.
This assignment was completed on the tux server and the programs are written in C.
This assignment was way more difficult that I thought it would be. I had help from a few friends understanding how forks and pipes work.
Running the file do generate error sometimes, it would just stop working altogether, I'm not sure of the reasons. But please give it a try or two, it should eventually start working.
