L1 - Pointers and Dynamic Memory

There are 5 programs, each corresponding to the questions given to us in the lab.

The compiler is basic gcc compiler. But I primarily tested the program using the online resource python tutor.

Requirements are quite simple, all you need is a C compiler and the standard libraries.
I would expect the program to run without any errors. But I can't say that with absolute certainty, probably no one can.

I enjoyed the tasks. They were moderately difficult. But I would like the requirements to be a little more specific, for example the functions to craete in question 5. Because I wasn't in the country at the moment, I had to take help from others, which is great in a way, but it was just not very convenient for me. But thanks again for the extension, and understanding my problems.
