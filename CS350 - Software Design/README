CS 350
Software Design

Taught by my favourite Professor at Drexel, Professor Jeff Salvage!
We learned a lot of Design Patterns in this course!
The main project was to create Survey-Test application, accesible via the Terminal during execution.
The program was to let the users, create, modify, take, tabualte (and grade) survey and test.
We did everything in Java.

Cheers
