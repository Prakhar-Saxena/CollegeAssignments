Junit Lab for Drexel CS350

I've covered all the methods, but for some reason, the line coverage is still not 100% for some classes.

I found more than three bugs, but only three with my tests. The extra bug I found was I believe inteded for the extra credit.
Also I've commented out the bugs and corrected them, in order to pass my tests.

The first Bug is in CoinPack (around line 56)
    public boolean pennies(long penny){
        if(penny < 0) return false;
        cents[0] = (penny);// BUG: cents[0] = (penny + 5);
        return true;
    }

The second Bug is in Drawer (around line 50)
    public Drawer(CoinPack cp, BillPack bp){
        /* BUG
        int randInt = rand.nextInt(100);
        if(randInt < 40) bp = new BillPack();
        */
        this.cp = cp;
        this.bp = bp;
        this.totalCentValue = centValueFromBills(bp) + centValueFromCoins(cp);
    }

The third Bug is also in Drawer (around line 116)
    public void depositBills(long one, long five, long ten, long twenty, long fifty, long hundred){
        if(one < 0 || five < 0 || ten < 0 || twenty < 0 || fifty < 0 || hundred < 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Can't deposit negative bill value");
        /* BUG
        int randInt = rand.nextInt(100);
        if(randInt < 80) one = 100;
        */
        this.bp.ones(this.bp.ones() + one);
        this.bp.fives(this.bp.fives() + five);
        this.bp.tens(this.bp.tens() + ten);
        this.bp.twenties(this.bp.twenties() + twenty);
        this.bp.fifties(this.bp.fifties() + fifty);
        this.bp.hundreds(this.bp.hundreds() + hundred);
        this.totalCentValue += centValueFromBills(one, five, ten, twenty, fifty, hundred);
    }

Cheers
