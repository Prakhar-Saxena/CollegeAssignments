CS 380
Artificial Intelligence

This course was taught by Professor Dario Salvucci. He's one of my favorite professors at Drexel.
I learned a lot in this course! All the way from Tree search to Minimax AI algorithm to Q-learning, we even touched the surface of Deep Learning.
All the projects done in this class was in Python. I'm not a big fan of the language. But it was alright.
I also had an Honors in this course. My project was to implement the Minimax Algorithm in our first assignment's Models of Rush Hour.
It was a great course!

Cheers
