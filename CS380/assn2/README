I've added a makefile that I used for testing, I find makefile easier than bash scripts.

I understand that you wanted the scripts to display the boards horizontally, I'm sorry but I couldn't achieve that part, but everything else works fine. I had certain time constraints because I'm taking 20 credit hours this term, along with 3 other Computing related courses.
