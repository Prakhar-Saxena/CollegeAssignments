Hello,

This project requires python3 and a general python notebook client like Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab.

The dataset is not provided with the code because of the size restrictions in our remote git repository and perhaps Blackboard. The dataset can be found at Kaggle:
http://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/san-francisco-crime-classification

There are certain details about where the dataset must be stored.
For knn and k-means clustering it can be stored in a directory next to the project's directory named 'CS383_datasets'; this is because in those scripts refer the dataset directory as '../CS383_datasets/'. 
For SVM and Decision trees however, the dataset needs to be in the same directory as the scripts themselves.

This project requires the following dependencies:
pandas
numpy
math
copy
matplotlip.pyplot
matplotlib.cm
sklearn.model_selection
sklearn.linear_model
sklearn.preprocessing
sklearn.neighbors
sklearn.metrics
sklearn.pipeline
sklearn.ensemble
sklearn.svm
sklearn.cluster

To run any script just open it and click on 'run all cells'.

Cheers
