Prakhar Saxena | CS 472 Homework # 3 | November 3, 2020 | README

Introduction
THis assignment was implemented over a week using the following software and tools:
    - PyCharm
    - ViM
    - git (GitHub)
    - Windows Terminal
    - Tux

The assignment includes two files, 'ftpserver.py' and 'Logger.py'. It implements the server side of an FTP server.
I tried to satisfy all the requirements, however I fell sick to COVID over the weekend, and have had symptoms for about
a week now.

Just like the previous assignment, I've already spent over 12 hours on this assignment;
And again, I was led to believe this is a 3 credit course.

Either way, i was able to accomplish some major requirements of the assignment.

Accomplishments:
    - Command line processing
    - Handling arguments provided
    - all commands working
    - Handled all the errors to my knowledge; try-expected everywhere.
    - Logging
    - Questions; answered in a separate document

Difficulties and missed accomplishments:
Unfortunately due to time constraints, I wasn't able to test every single case of my server.
But I've documented and commented it well, so that I can take a shot at it after this term, when I have more time,
because it would keep bugging me.
This is one of the hardest assignments I have ever encountered.
The amount of hours I spent trying to comprehend the complex commands going through the RFCs and testing them out on the
very inconsistent FTP clients on windows and tux, I found terribly frustrating.

How to run the program:
I have created a makefile for your ease. All you have to do is type:
    make
It should print out the IP and port that this server is then running on. You can copy that and run it using your
ftp client. Now you can run all the commands requried of the server.

You can find the logs in:
    log_file
In order to clean the log_file you can just run:
    make clean

The 'Questions to be answered' are in a pdf in the same directory.
