computer chess generally proceeds in three phases the opening moves can be played from a book of best moves as the number of board configurations are relatively small midgame proceeds with the computer determining each move as though it is the first move of a brandnew game with a new board configuration to start with it does this by looking ahead as far as can be done reasonably within the time constraints with a heuristic used to evaluate the board configurations that result design of this heuristic and means of deciding when to quit looking in one direction and begin another are two of the difficult decisions that require the programmers to impart both intelligence and to some degree their own personalities into the machine when the game has progressed to a point where few pieces remain the endgame phase is reached and predetermined sequences of moves may be employed to guide the machine deep blue maintains an opening game database of grandmaster games played in the last hundred years according to hsu and team member murray campbell with whom i spoke afterwards midgame is guided by a fairly straightforward minimax procedure with alphabeta pruning and several enhancements their evaluation function is quite complex as is their means of terminating branches deep blue derives most of its power from its specialized hardware designed specifically for playing chess according to ibm online archives there are vlsi chess processors operating in parallel which together can analyze roughly many billion chess positions in three minutes random access memory has been designed precisely for representation of chessboards determination of moves evaluation of heuristics etc when five chess pieces remain on the board endgame scenarios are recalled from readonly memory
