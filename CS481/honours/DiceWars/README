Hello Professor,
You will need Python 2 and package pygame installed. You can install it using pip: pip install pygame.
Now all you need to run this game is to execute it using python.exe (Python2):
    python run_game.py
And Viola! hopefully it works. I have not tested this game on tux, because I didn't create it in tux.
There are some components like the chat box might not function well, I was just experimenting around with that.
But since it wasn't a part of the requirements, I just dropped it as it is. I'm taking a lot of classes this term,
so I didn't have much time to be done with it.
Hope you enjoy playing this.
Cheers
Prakhar Saxena
