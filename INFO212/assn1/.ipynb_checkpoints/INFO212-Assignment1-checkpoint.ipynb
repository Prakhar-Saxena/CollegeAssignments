    "### A. Assignment Overview\n",
    "This assignment provides the opportunity for you to practice with Python basics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. What to Hand In\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Sumbit a completed this Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. How to Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your Jupyter notebook file through the course website in the Blackboard Learn system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. When to Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit your assignment no later than 11:59pm in the due date.\n",
    "2. There will be a 10% (absolute value) deduction for each day of lateness, to a maximum of 3 days; assignments will not be accepted beyond that point. Missing work will earn a zero grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Written Presentation Requirements (if applicable)\n",
    "Images must be clear and legible. Assignments will be judged on the basis of visual appearance, grammatical correctness, and quality of writing, as well as their contents. Please make sure that the text of your assignments is well-structured, using paragraphs, full sentences, and other features of well-written presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### F. Marking Schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Marking assignments will be based on several aspects: presentation, correctness and coding styles. \n",
    "\n",
    "For programming questions, 10% of the mark will be judged on the coding style. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a set of guidelines for the coding style in this course:\n",
    "1. Write a good comment for each variable, each method, each control branch, and each loop.\n",
    "2. Use appropriate indentations to indicate control flows and blocks of code. \n",
    "3. Your method comments must mention the purpose of each parameter, and must be grammatically correct. \n",
    "4. Each line must be less than 80 characters long including tabs and spaces. \n",
    "5. Put a blank space before and after every operator. \n",
    "6. When breaking up a long line, break it before an operator, not after. \n",
    "\n",
    "### G. Answer the following questions"
