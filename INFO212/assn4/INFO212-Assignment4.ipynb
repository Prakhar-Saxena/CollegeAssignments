    "Images must be clear and legible. Assignments will be judged on the basis of visual appearance, grammatical correctness, and quality of writing, as well as their contents. Please make sure that the text of your assignments is well-structured, using paragraphs, full sentences, and other features of well-written presentation. Text font size should be at least 11 points.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following is a set of guidelines for the coding style in this course:\n",
    "1. Write a good comments.\n",
    "2. Your method comments must mention the purpose of each parameter, and must be grammatically correct. \n",

    "Download the dataset: `loan-applications.csv` and load it into a data frame. The data set contains several hundreds of loan application data. This data set provides a glimse of what bank and insurance companies facing during their data analyses. The goal is to automate the loan application process based on applicants' information. This data set contains many features of applicants, including: `Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others`. The main problem is that the data set contains missing values and different types of data. Here, you are asked to write code to clean and visualize the data and answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. List the number of missing values for each column.\n",
    "2. Remove the applications each of which has more than 2 missing values.\n",
    "3. Forward fill up the missing values for columns with Object data type.\n",
    "4. Fill up the missing values with their means for columns with numerical data types.\n",
    "5. After the above steps, show that there are no missing data in the DataFrame.\n",
    "6. Plot the relationship between Education and ApplicantIncome.\n",
    "7. Plot the relationship between Property_Area and Loan_Status.\n",
    "8. Categorize the ApplicantIncome into low (0-2000), medium (2000-20000), High(20000-50000), and Rich(>50000).\n",
    "9. Plot the relationship between Loan_Status and the categories of ApplicantIncome.\n",
    "10. Categorize the CoapplicantIncome into low (0-2000), medium (2000-10000), High(10000-20000), and Rich(>20000).\n",
    "11. Plot the relationship between Loan_Status and the categories of CoapplicantIncome. \n",
    "12. Develop plots to show the relationships between Load_Status and Education, Married, Credit_History. \n",
    "13. For all the columns with no-numerical data (except for Loan_ID), convert the values to numerical categorical representations."
